pointr - Award your friends Points!!
=======================

## Synopsis

**_pointr_** is the third project from Fats Inc and formed the final part of our Final Project on the Makers Academy Bootcamp. **_pointr_** is a native iOS App which allows users to friend their friends and award them points (from 1 to 10). A simple App, but this was our first venture into Swift and Xcode and was produced in under a week. We used Parse for our database. We were aided in our learning by [Ray Wednerlich's Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com) and received some valuable input from @neilkimmett too (thank you Neil!).

## Favourite Code Snippet

~~~
 self.chooseFriend.reloadAllComponents()

This may seem like a very basic snippet of code, but it took us a long, long time to crack the issue of getting the Picker Wheel to reload with the updated friends list!

## Still to complete/refactor

- [ ] Learn how to test Swift and Xcode
- [ ] Occasionally App crashes when you try to access the Send Points Page too quickly after Start-Up

## Takeaway

If you put your mind to it you can achieve anything! Having completed a Web Development Bootcamp we had no experience developing Mobile Apps, let alone a native iOS one! We learnt Swift basics for 2 days and played around with some Xcode and Parse Tutorials. We then jumped into building this App and we were not sure we could even build it in the three days we had left. But we did! It is a simple App, but it works!
